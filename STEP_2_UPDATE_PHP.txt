======================================
STEP 2: Update api.php file
======================================

1. Open your api.php file on the server

2. Find this line:
   case 'add_application':

3. Replace EVERYTHING from "case 'add_application':" 
   until the "break;" 
   with the code from "api_leave_application_fix.php"

4. Save the file

5. Clear any server cache (if you have caching enabled)

IMPORTANT: Make sure you replace the ENTIRE case block, not just part of it!
