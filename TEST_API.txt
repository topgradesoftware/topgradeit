======================================
STEP 1: Test if PHP files are updating
======================================

1. I created a file called "test_api_version.php" in your project
2. Upload this file to your server (same folder as api.php)
3. Open in browser: http://your-server.com/test_api_version.php
4. You should see: {"test":"API file check","timestamp":"..."}

If you see this JSON, your PHP updates are working ✓
If you see error or blank page, PHP updates are NOT working ✗
